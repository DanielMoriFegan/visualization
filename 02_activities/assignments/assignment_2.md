# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
          Good Visualisaiton: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mateusz.karmalski/viz/CountrieswiththeMostHolidaysin2024makeovermonday/Dashboard12

        First, the good visualisation does not have 3D features. The visualisation follows the hierarchy of overview, filter and details on demand. Specifically, with the bar graphs, we are able to get an overview of all patterns in the number of days which are holidays, whilst highlighted countries give a quick summarisation of which countries have the longest holidays. Additionally, information such as the average and minimum was clearly identifiable. Although zoom was not available, the visualisation allows for filtering of countries and provides details on demand as well.  As the visualisation is a bar graph, it is easy to identify countries with higher and lower dates, whilst the additional link to the map below also helps orientate the audience. In addition, colour coding of darker saturation indicating higher numbers was a benefit. The visualisation has a neutral tone, which also allows the audience to explore the data without bias/prejudice. 
        
        Bad Visualisation: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vizgrowth/viz/Formula12024LapTimesBeeswarm/Beeswarm

        The bad visualisation looks at F1 lap times in a scatterplot looking at fastest and slowest laps for every race and driver. However, the visualisation does not have any legend explaining the colours, nor which point represents which driver. Additionally, the lack of a y-axis does not help explain what the spread of the data indicates. Additionally, the x-axis has labels of fastest and slowest but does not give the actual time intervals. When it comes to the hierarchy of overview, zoom, filter and details on demand, the visualisation fails on all except for details on demand. First, although we can see there are more faster lap times compared to slower lap times, we cannot identify what the spread of the data means. With zoom, we cannot filter for specific drivers or races. The visualisation also does not allow for filtering. The visualisation does allow for some details on demand, however, getting the detail that the audience may want specifically is nigh impossible to get. The colour coding is not intuitive especially as there is no legend. The spread of data also makes it impossible for the audience to explore or discover the messages in the visualisation.


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
        For the 'good' visualisation, a key limitation is that the bars are spaced out in accordance to the location on the atlas. Due to this, there is overlapping of bars, making it hard to distinguish the countries in Europe. Due to this, an additional figure may have been beneficial in which you could fulfil the 'zoom' hierarchy where you could filter and focus in on specific regions. In addition to this, issues with the colour shading can be identified, where although there is a saturation spectrum on the bottom, it is a bit hard to identify specific shades on the graph. Additionally, this spectrum should have been higher up closer to the bars, to allow for easier comparisons. 
          
        For the 'bad' visualisation, a legend must be added to allow the audience to understand what each colour indicates. Additionally, a y-axis with labelling is needed as currently, the audience cannot understand what the spread of the data represents. Additionally, labelling of the x-axis is required, as a simple 'fastest' and 'slowest' is not beneficial. To achieve  the hierarchy, the designer should have created filtering options for the different drivers and races to achieve the zoom, filter and details on demand concepts. Additionally, the designer could have separated the graphs into several parts, where each section would cover individual races to simplify the visualisation.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
